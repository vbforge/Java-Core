# Java OOP Mastery Guide

A comprehensive educational repository demonstrating core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, design patterns, and best practices in Java. This project serves as a structured learning path from basic concepts to advanced OOP techniques.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository contains practical implementations and examples covering the complete spectrum of OOP in Java, organized into focused modules. Each package demonstrates specific concepts with working code examples, making it ideal for students, beginners, and developers looking to strengthen their OOP foundations.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction
- Understand relationships between objects: Association, Aggregation, Composition, and Delegation
- Apply SOLID principles in real-world scenarios
- Recognize and implement proper code organization patterns
- Develop intuition for object-oriented design decisions

## 📦 Package Structure

### Foundational Concepts

- **`classes_objects`** - Introduction to classes, objects, and instances
- **`encapsulation_app01`** & **`encapsulation_app02`** - Data hiding and access control
- **`change_access_modifier`** - Understanding public, private, protected, and package-private
- **`static_final`** - Static members, constants, and class-level behavior

### Inheritance & Polymorphism

- **`inheritance_app01`**, **`inheritance_app02`**, **`inheritance_app03`** - Parent-child relationships and code reuse
- **`super_keyword`** - Working with parent class references
- **`static_method_inheritance`** - Static method behavior in hierarchies
- **`polymorphism_app01`** & **`polymorphism_app02`** - Runtime polymorphism and method overriding
- **`override_methods_cases`** - Proper method overriding techniques
- **`overloading`** - Method overloading and compile-time polymorphism
- **`early_binding`** & **`late_binding`** - Static vs dynamic method dispatch
- **`casting_instanceof`** - Type casting and runtime type checking

### Abstraction

- **`abstraction_app01`** & **`abstraction_app02`** - Abstract classes and interfaces
- **`lsp_adherence`** - Liskov Substitution Principle implementation

### Object Relationships

- **`association`** - Loose relationships between objects
- **`aggregation`** - "Has-a" relationships with independent lifecycles
- **`composition`** - Strong ownership relationships
- **`delegation`** - Delegating behavior to other objects

### Design Quality

- **`cohesion`** - Building focused, single-purpose classes
- **`coupling`** - Managing dependencies between classes
- **`designer_chains`** - Method chaining and fluent interfaces

### Core Java Methods

- **`equals`** - Implementing proper object equality
- **`hashCode`** - Hash code contracts and collections compatibility
- **`hiding_fields`** - Field shadowing in inheritance hierarchies

### Practice Assignments

- **`assignment1`** through **`assignment5`** - Progressive exercises applying learned concepts
- **`theory_common`** - Shared utilities and common theoretical implementations
- **`demo`** - Complete working examples and demonstrations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Basic understanding of Java syntax


## 📖 Recommended Learning Path

For beginners, follow this sequence:

1. **Basics**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Polymorphism**
4. **Abstraction**
5. **Relationships**
6. **Best Practices**
7. **Core Methods**
8. **Apply Knowledge**

## 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

### The Four Pillars of OOP

1. **Encapsulation** - Bundling data and methods, controlling access
2. **Inheritance** - Code reuse through parent-child relationships
3. **Polymorphism** - One interface, multiple implementations
4. **Abstraction** - Hiding complex implementation details

### Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle** - Demonstrated through cohesion examples
- **Liskov Substitution Principle** - Explicit LSP adherence package
- **Proper coupling management** - Loose coupling examples
- **High cohesion techniques** - Focused class design

### Advanced Topics

- Method binding (early vs late)
- Type casting and runtime type information
- Field hiding vs method overriding
- Static context in inheritance
- Proper implementation of `equals()` and `hashCode()`

## 🛠️ Best Practices Demonstrated

- Clear naming conventions
- Proper encapsulation techniques
- Effective use of access modifiers
- Composition over inheritance where appropriate
- Contract-based programming with interfaces
- Immutability with final keyword usage
